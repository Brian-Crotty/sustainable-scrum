# sustainable-scrum
Our team has a diverse background in multiple fields including Computer Science, Data Analytics, Remote Data Collection, User Experience, Environmental Philosophy, Mathematics, and Physics. Our team consists of mainly seniors completing their Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and includes a physics major, two math minors, and two philosophy minors. We provide years of experience working with not only data analysis, but particularly environmental data and sustainability analysis. 

Our plan has three parts. The first is to develop a simple to understand, interactive dashboard to provide easily accessible sustainability analysis. The second is to create a database backend for centralized sustainability and consumption data for the various resources. The third is to create remote data monitoring systems using Raspberry Pis (a low energy, low cost computer) to provide a cost effective way to collect the data at utility meters around Denison. Our team has the capability and drive to complete this project. 

Each of our fields includes the study of resource efficiency and sustainability practices, especially physics and philosophy. We believe that our particular skill sets and qualifications make us the optimal choice for a project involving data analysis and representation of Denison’s resource usage and sustainability. If given this project, we will be equipped to utilize our experiences with sustainability analysis, remote data collection, and software design to create an elegant and interactive dashboard for Denison’s resource usage. We look forward to working with Denison to create a more sustainable Denison.
